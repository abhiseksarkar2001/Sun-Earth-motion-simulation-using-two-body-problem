# Sun-Earth-motion-simulation-using-two-body-problem
This code simulates the motion of the Earth around the Sun using the two-body problem. The two-body problem is a simplified model of the motion of two celestial bodies, such as the Sun and Earth, under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction. The code uses numerical integration to solve the equations of motion and plot the positions and velocities of the Sun and Earth over time.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have the following packages installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:

```pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ```

## Output
This will generate two plots:

* Position of Sun and Earth over time
* Velocity of Sun and Earth over time

Additionally, the code also calculates the total energy and angular momentum of the system and plots them over time.

## Built With
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Numerical computing library for python
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/) - Scientific computing library for python
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Plotting library for python
